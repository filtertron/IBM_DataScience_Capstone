    "This project is rooted in experience.  Some years ago our family vacationed on Anna Maria Island in Florida, USA.  Once we were settled in the hotel we sought and found a local beach restaurant with a full parking lot, on the theory that if so many other people thought it was a good restaurant, we probably would too.  I ordered what were described as \"conch fritters.\"  This turned out to be a serious mistake.  Within 8 hours I was violently ill and was confined to the hotel room for the entire 8 days we had planned to stay.\n",
    "One learning from this experience was: a full parking lot does not necessarily imply a good, or even a safe, dining experience.  Another was: it might have been very helpful to have known the restaurant's history with local health authorities, as well as any reviews other patrons had shared, before digging in to those conch fritters."
